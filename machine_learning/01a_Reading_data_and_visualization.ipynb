Once you read anything into a variable v, you can print(v) to see the contents of v. Use this to understand the data inside v. Further, depending on the type of v, you can do print(v.shape), print(len(v)), print(v.size). Use print extensively to understand as well as to debug your own code!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"n7Ef24hVQm-q"},"source":["-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","<h2> <u>Import required modules</u> </h2>\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"nqv3iU8zQm-q"},"source":["import numpy as np # numerical library\n","import matplotlib.pylab as plt # for plotting\n","import pandas as pd # data handling similar to R"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VzyYTjK7ttNu"},"source":["<h2> <u>Mount Google drive folder</u> </h2>\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"F7a7g5tRRSHi"},"source":["# Mount Google drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ToRnBOYVQxgQ"},"source":["cd /content/drive/My Drive/ML_workshop"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LHG_8ysJX43S"},"source":["ls"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AfmCSiVNQm-r"},"source":["-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","<h2> <u>Toy data for Regression</u> </h2>\n","\n","In regression, the goal to approximate a mapping from an input to an output, where the output is an integer or floating point value.
