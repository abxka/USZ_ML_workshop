1) First you need to install python for the below version or above:
Python 3.6.1.

We recommend installing anaconda as it will by default install most of the libraries required for the tutorial.
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
 
or, you can install just the python & later install individual libraries seperately.
You can refer to the below link for installation of python.

2) The required libraries can be installed with the below commands.
pip install numpy
