# Tutorial on Machine Learning

**Tutorial mainly prepared by: Ender Konukoglu, Christian F. Baumgartner, Krishna Chaitanya** <br />

In this practical session, participants will learn about basics of machine learning and gain hands on experience with applying available tools. <br />

This tutorial consists of two parts: The first part covers basic Machine Learning concepts and the second part is devoted to introduction for Deep Learning. <br />

Machine learning tutorial consists of two parts: <br />

 * **Part I**: is devoted to learning the basics that will include the following concepts: <br />
  (a) Reading and visualizing data. <br />
  (b) Supervised learning: toy classification and regression with linear models. <br />
  (c) Supervised learning: toy classification and regression with non-linear models. <br />

 * **Part II**: participants will work on real-world data problems: <br />
  (d) automatic diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease from brain MRI and age regression from brain MRI. <br />

Deep learning tutorial contains four parts: <br />

 * **Part I**: Covers basics of the `tensorflow` library.
 * **Part II**: Due to time constraints, we will skip this part in the workshop. You may study this after the workshop, from the solns directory.
 * **Part III**: In this part, you will learn about the convolution operation and how the weights of a convolution kernel can be learned to produce a desired output.
 * **Part IV**: In the last part you will learn how convolution layers along with other types of layers can be combined to build and train a state-of-the-art medical segmentation network.
